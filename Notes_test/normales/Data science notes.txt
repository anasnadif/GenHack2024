Course: Introduction to Data Science

Week 1: Foundations of Data Science

Understanding Data Science:

Definition: Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.
Importance: Data science helps in making informed decisions, predicting trends, and gaining valuable insights from large datasets.
Key Concepts:

Data Types: Different types of data - numerical, categorical, and text data.
Data Sources: Learning about various sources of data, including databases, APIs, and web scraping.
Data Exploration: Techniques for exploring and understanding datasets using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Week 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data Cleaning:

Importance: Clean data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.
Techniques: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
Data Preprocessing:

Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Scaling and Normalization: Standardizing features to ensure equal importance in the modeling process.
Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA Techniques:

Univariate Analysis: Examining a single variable to understand its distribution.
Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing relationships between two variables.
Multivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships among multiple variables simultaneously.
Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Creating static visualizations for data exploration.
Plotly: Generating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
Week 4: Statistical Analysis for Data Science

Descriptive Statistics:

Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, mode.
Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, standard deviation.
Inferential Statistics:

Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the basics of hypothesis testing and p-values.
Confidence Intervals: Estimating the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall.
Week 5: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Supervised Learning:

Classification vs. Regression: Differentiating between predicting categories and predicting numerical values.
Algorithms: Introduction to linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Unsupervised Learning:

Clustering: Grouping similar data points together using algorithms like K-means clustering.
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Week 6: Model Evaluation and Selection

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score: Metrics for assessing model performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the performance of a classification model.
Cross-Validation:

Techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess how well a model generalizes to new data.
Week 7: Big Data and Tools

Introduction to Big Data:

Definition and characteristics of big data.
Challenges in processing and analyzing large datasets.
Big Data Tools:

Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark: Understanding distributed computing frameworks for big data processing.
Week 8: Capstone Project

Applying the learned concepts to a real-world problem.
Developing a complete data science pipeline from data collection to model deployment.
Presentation and documentation of the project
